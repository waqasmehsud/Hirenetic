# Directory Structure

## 1. Principle

Every folder below exists to enforce one rule: **a new feature is additive.** If you're building "comments" or "billing" or "notifications-v2", you should be able to point to exactly one new top-level thing you added (a route folder, a migration, maybe a lib module) and nothing you had to _change_ in the core. If a feature genuinely requires changing `proxy.ts` or `lib/auth`, that's a signal to pause and reconsider — flagged explicitly here so it isn't done casually.

## 2. Top-Level Layout

## 3. The Feature Module Pattern (the core extensibility mechanism)

Every new domain feature follows this exact shape. Use it as a checklist when adding something new:

1. **Schema:** `db/schema/<feature>.ts` (Drizzle definition) + `db/migrations/xxxx_<feature>.sql` (generated/reviewed migration), with RLS policies included in the same migration — never added later.
2. **Validation:** `lib/validation/<feature>.schema.ts` — Zod schema, imported by both the API route and any client-side form.
3. **API:** `app/api/v1/<feature>/route.ts` (and `[id]/route.ts` for item-level operations) — uses `lib/auth/guards.ts` for authorization, `lib/validation/<feature>.schema.ts` for input validation, and the server Supabase client for data access.
4. **UI:** `components/<feature>/` for feature-specific components; `app/(dashboard)/<feature>/page.tsx` if it needs its own route.
5. **Tests:** `tests/unit/<feature>/`, `tests/integration/<feature>/`, and an E2E spec if it's part of a critical journey.

Nothing in this list touches `proxy.ts`, `lib/auth/session.ts`, `lib/supabase/*`, or the CI/CD config. If a feature seems to require that, it's probably actually a change to _core_ auth/infra behavior — treat it as its own reviewed, deliberate change, not something bundled into a feature PR.

## 4. Why Route Groups (`(auth)`, `(dashboard)`)

Next.js route groups let us apply different layouts (public auth pages vs. authenticated app shell) without affecting the URL structure. This keeps `proxy.ts` simple: it can pattern-match on route groups/paths to decide what needs a session, rather than every page implementing its own check.

## 5. Why `lib/supabase/admin.ts` Is Isolated and Flagged

The service-role Supabase client bypasses RLS entirely. It is deliberately kept in its own file, imported only where absolutely necessary (e.g., an admin-triggered bulk operation, a scheduled job) — never in a Route Handler that processes arbitrary user input. This isolation makes it easy to grep the codebase for every place RLS is bypassed and audit each one, per NFR-3.

## 6. Environment-Specific Files

- `docker/docker-compose.yml` supports environment-specific overrides via Compose profiles or additional override files (`docker-compose.override.yml` for local dev tweaks) — detailed in `deployment.md`.
- `.env.example` documents variables for all three environments in one annotated file (see `deployment.md` §3); actual values never live in the repo.
